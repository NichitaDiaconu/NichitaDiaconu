## Professional Experience

### Senior Machine Learning Engineer  

[Klue](https://klue.com/) | Vancouver, Canada (01/2023–Present)

- Lead projects involving multiple teams, ensuring project goals align with business needs and identifying potential blockers early.
- Build an LLM application with prompt management and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), improving user engagement by 25\% and reducing the time to value by 49\%.
- Implement a solution for news grouping, reducing content overlap by 40\%. Developed a custom online clustering algorithm and ensured data consistency across distributed systems.
- Develop a subscription-based scraping service, reducing manual labor by 81\%.
- Create a pipeline for transcript annotation using WhisperX, cutting transcription costs by 46\% and increasing accuracy by 5\%.

### Machine Learning Engineer  

[Klue](https://klue.com/) | Amsterdam, Netherlands (01/2020–12/2022)

- Designed and implemented the document pipeline, processing hundreds of thousands of news items daily for thousands of clients.
- Developed a rule-based management \& filtering system using boolean logic, providing configurable filtering rules.
- Created a junk filtering solution based on a custom Named Entity Recognition model and a tree-based classification model. We compared labeling services, created custom datasets, and trained models, resulting in a 93\% reduction in irrelevant content.
- Built a topic tagging system using multi-class, multi-label deep learning models, increasing user retention by 21\%.
- Oversaw data handling, metrics definition, model tuning, and deployment, while monitoring performance across all projects.

### Research Intern  

Philips Lab | Amsterdam, Netherlands (02/2019–09/2019)

- Improved parameter efficiency and robustness in vision models, culminating in the paper "Affine Self Convolution."

### Computer Vision Intern  

Bosch | Cluj-Napoca, Romania (02/2016–05/2016)

- Improved the scale sensitivity of an existing object detection solution by implementing techniques inspired by the "Fastest Pedestrian Detector in the West" paper. Learned about scale invariance and object detection.

## Publications

- [**Learning to Convolve (Main Author):**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04663) ICML 2019 - Amsterdam, Netherlands (02/2019)  
  Developed a method to learn transformations in group convolutions, enabling filters to adapt to transformations and reducing sensitivity to input rotations.

- [**Affine Self Convolution (Main Author):**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07704) Philips Lab - Amsterdam, Netherlands (11/2019)  
  Introduced Affine Self Convolution, which uses data-dependent filters for image processing, combining self-attention with convolution to improve accuracy and parameter efficiency.
